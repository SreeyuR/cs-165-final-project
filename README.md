# CS 165 Final Project

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains **22,556** total shots, each representing a single time series data point that either ends in a **disruption** or not. Each shot is associated with one of three major **tokamaks**:

- **C-MOD**
- **DIII-D**
- **EAST**

Every shot includes:
- A **label**:  
  - `0` for non-disruptive sequences  
  - `1` for disruptive sequences  
- A **machine identifier** (C-MOD, DIII-D, or EAST)  
- A **unique shot index**
- A **dataframe** containing hundreds of rows (depending on the length of the sequence) and **13 feature columns**

The dataset is **open-sourced** and publicly available at:

## Class Balance

In the full dataset, **non-disruptive shots outnumber disruptive ones** by a ratio of approximately **5.5:1**. This class imbalance is preserved in all dataset splits to reflect real-world distributions.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing pipeline includes two stages: **global preprocessing (before train-test split)** and **per-run preprocessing (after data is loaded for a specific experiment)**.

### Global Preprocessing

Before splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, we apply a **clipping operation** on the raw data:

- **All feature values are clipped at the 1st and 99th percentiles**.
- This reduces the influence of extreme outliers and stabilizes the distributions.

### Per-Run Preprocessing

After the dataset is split and saved to disk, each experimental run applies additional preprocessing steps depending on the configuration:

- **Standardizing interval length**:  
  Each shot is truncated or padded to match a fixed temporal length (defined per-machine or globally).
  
- **Undersampling the training set**:  
  To address class imbalance, a configurable portion of non-disruptive shots may be undersampled during training.

- **Data augmentation**:  
  Additional transformations may be applied to augment training data. This includes resampling, masking, or injecting slight noise.

- **Autoregressive cutoff**:  
  A portion of the end of each time series may be **masked or removed** to simulate early warning prediction scenarios, forcing the model to infer disruptions from partial information.

These steps allow us to simulate realistic use cases and robustly test the modelâ€™s generalization and early prediction ability.

## Dataset Splits

The dataset is split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets using pre-defined indices stored in the `data/indices/` directory. Each "case" file defines a different experimental setting:

| Case # | Train Source(s)     | Validation Source(s) | Test Source(s)     |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| 1      | DIII-D               | DIII-D               | DIII-D             |

| Validation  | EAST    | 1498           | 20.69%        |


Case 12 uses a split from prior work ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00051)) with a reduced class imbalance, particularly in the test set.

## Data Inclusion / Exclusion

All available shots from the three tokamaks (C-MOD, DIII-D, EAST) were included in the dataset. No shots were excluded unless explicitly filtered through the split indices described above. These splits were designed to:

- Preserve **class ratios** across splits  
- Allow for **machine-specific** and **cross-machine generalization** studies  
- Enable **realistic distribution learning** for predictive modeling
